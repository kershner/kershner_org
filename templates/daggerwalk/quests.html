  <details open>
    <summary>How do quests and logs work?</summary>
    <p>Every 5 minutes the game sends a log of the current state to the server. Each log records the Walker's location, chat commands, and more. Quests are checked and updated when a new log arrives.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What happens when a quest completes?</summary>
    <p>When a log matches the quest’s target POI, the quest is marked completed, all qualifying users are awarded, and a new quest immediately begins.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I get XP?</summary>
    <p>Send a chat command during the quest window (from when the quest starts until the log that completes it). If your command appears in one of those logs, you’re credited.</p>
